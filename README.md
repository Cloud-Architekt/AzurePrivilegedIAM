# Privileged Identity & Access in Microsoft Entra
Docs, resources and samples to implement a secure privileged identity and access management in Microsoft Azure and Microsoft Entra.

## üìù Classification of Roles and Permissions
I've created an approach to automate classification of role actions based on Microsoft's Enterprise Access Model. Samples of the classification file which I've created for the implementation in EntraOps can be found here:

* [EntraOps - Defined Classification of Entra ID Role Actions in JSON](https://github.com/Cloud-Architekt/AzurePrivilegedIAM/blob/main/EntraOps_Classification/Classification_AadResources.json)
* [EntraOps - Defined Classification of Microsoft Graph API Permissions in JSON](https://github.com/Cloud-Architekt/AzurePrivilegedIAM/blob/main/EntraOps_Classification/Classification_AppRoles.json)

The generated classification (based on the previous definition files) are also available and can be used as lookup in analytics rules (in Microsoft Sentinel) or to built your own automation and/or entity enrichment:

* [Classified Entra ID Roles in JSON](https://github.com/Cloud-Architekt/AzurePrivilegedIAM/blob/main/Classification/Classification_EntraIdDirectoryRoles.json)
* [Classified Microsoft Graph API Permissions in JSON](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Cloud-Architekt/AzurePrivilegedIAM/main/Classification/Classification_AppRoles.json)

Sample queries to use classification in KQL queries in Microsoft Sentinel can be found here:

* [List of (active/permanent) Directory role member with enriched classification](https://github.com/Cloud-Architekt/AzureSentinel/blob/main/Hunting%20Queries/EID-PrivilegedIdentities/DirectoryRoleMemberWithClassification.kusto)
* [Added API Permissions with enriched classification from EntraOps Privileged EAM](https://github.com/Cloud-Architekt/AzureSentinel/blob/main/Hunting%20Queries/EID-PrivilegedIdentities/AddedAppRolesWithClassification.kusto)

The helper script to create classification by using the definition of classification are available here:

* [Script for Classification of Entra ID Roles](./Get-EntraOpsClassificationDirectoryRoles.ps1)
* [Script for Classification of Microsoft Graph API Permission](./Scripts/Get-EntraOpsClassificationAppRoles.ps1)

Side Note: The classification export of App Roles (`Get-EntraOpsClassificationAppRoles`) can also include a list of "Authorized Api Calls" by using the Parameter `IncludeAuthorizedApiCalls`. This information will be enriched from the GitHub project "[graphpermissions.github.io](https://github.com/merill/graphpermissions.github.io)" (created by [Merill Fernando](https://github.com/merill)). Kudos to Merill!

### üì¢ Call for Community Contributors!
Mostly, role actions and permissions on Control Plane has been classified. There are still a high number of "unclassified" role actions and maybe also some classified roles which should be reviewed or may assessed differently. As already described, the source for all classification will be managed in the "[EntraOps_Classification](https://github.com/Cloud-Architekt/AzurePrivilegedIAM/tree/main/EntraOps_Classification)" files and should be the single point for modification to this project. I would be more than happy to see contributions by the community which helps to increase the coverage and quality of the classification for the Enterprise Access Model. Feel free to create PR, issues or contact me if you have any further questions or feedback.

## üîÅ Lifecycle Workflows
On- and Offboarding of Privileged Accounts can be automated with the Entra ID Governance feature "Lifecycle workflows". Samples for the custom tasks can be found here and are described in the blog post "[Automated Lifecycle Workflows for Privileged Identities with Azure AD Identity Governance](https://www.cloud-architekt.net/manage-privileged-identities-with-azuread-identity-governance/)"

## üìÑ Role Definition Matrix of Personas for Privileged Access in Microsoft Azure
Various articles on Microsoft Learn describes Roles and Personas for privileged access in Azure. I've created a role definition matrix to compare the descriptions of personas but also tiering levels from Enterprise Access Model. Check out the "[EAS_EAM_AzureRBAC_TabularSummary.pdf](https://github.com/Cloud-Architekt/AzurePrivilegedIAM/blob/main/EAS_EAM_AzureRBAC_TabularSummary.pdf)"

## ü§ñ Scripts for Automation and Definition of Classification
Examples for PowerShell Scripts to export a list of privileged assignments in Azure (incl. Azure Billing/Enterprise Agreement) and also helper files for Classification can be found [here](https://github.com/Cloud-Architekt/AzurePrivilegedIAM/tree/main/Scripts).
